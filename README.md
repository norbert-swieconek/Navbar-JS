# Navbar - JS
Navbar with hamburger menu and nested drop-down menu, created with pure JS.

## General info
Navbar comes from tutorial freeCodeCamp.org but I modified it. I added **nested drop-down menu**.

* **nested drop-down menu** - when you click 'About' then the menu will drop-down. It's friendly to the mobiles.
